How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff highlights changes to make them easier to find

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Makes catostrophes avoiable
    Can figure out why changes were made

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: Logical commits, tailored messages
    Con: May forget to commit and lose work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    source code files are usually interdependant and should be saved as a group
    google docs sees each file as a self-contained unit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat to see files and # of changed
    git diff <1st id> <prev id> to see the changes that were made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back in time to fix broken changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   All my code!
